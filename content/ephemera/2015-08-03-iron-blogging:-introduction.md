It's been a while since I've written here.

Hopefully, at least for a period of time, posting will be a lot more frequent.

A few of us in GroupLens have decided to try our hands at Iron Blogging, which is a process to create accountability for writing every week, and building writing skill, on topics related to our field.

So, I'll be using the "Iron Blogging" prefix to posts that are associated with this effort. It'll likely be a combination of thoughts about topics I'm academically interested in, paper reviews, and other ephemera.
