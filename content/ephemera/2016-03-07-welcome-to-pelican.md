You know, I've really started to come around on python.

What this actually means, in this case, is that I've completely moved away from [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws), and now my site is generated by [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com).

The transition was relatively straightforward, although there may still be some bugs here and there.

One major change, at this point, is that my URLs have completely changed, which is probably not ideal? I don't really know that it matters, but I'll be looking to see if I can to rewrites on URLs with `nginx`.

The biggest benefit, to me, is auto-generation of a publication page. Specifically `pelican-bibtex`. This lets me put a BibTeX file in a directory, generate a specific page to post these papers on, and `pelican-bibtex` does the rest. I ended up [forking](https://github.com/jtsmn/pelican-bibtex) it a bit, so that I can do some hacky things (like call "unpublished" bibtex entries 'Posters and Extended Abstracts', and 'inproceedings' bibtex entries 'Papers'), as well as allowing for ACM Author-izer links in the BibTeX file. Overall though, this means I can put my publications in one spot, and my site generator adds it to my [publications page](http://jacob.thebault-spieker.com/papers.html).
