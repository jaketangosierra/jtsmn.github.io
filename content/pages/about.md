Title: About

I'm currently 28 years old, and am in my 6th year as a PhD student.

During my undergraduate career at the [University of Minnesota -
Morris](http://www.morris.umn.edu/academics/computerscience/), I focused my work
primarily on [OpenAFS](http://www.openafs.org) and distributed systems,
completing 2 years of Google Summer of Code (2008 and 2009), as well as a summer
REU at Carnegie Mellon working on [Internet Suspend and
Resume](http://isr.cmu.edu).

After these experiences, my interests broadened to technology that has a more
direct impact societally.

My research interests encompass organizational structures and motivations that
support strong participation within sociotechnical systems. In particular, I'm
interested in these towards supporting social change and civic engagement
through mobile technologies.  I'm interested in using mobile technologies and
systems  to more deeply understand the organizational and social structures and
their roles in participation within these communities and systems.

I currently work on FolkSource, a smartphone and web platform for crowdsourcing
real-world data gathering, for use by non-profits, advocacy groups, and local
municipalities.

During the summer of 2014, I was an IBM Watson intern, working at IBM Research Almaden.
