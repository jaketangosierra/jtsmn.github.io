I'm cheating a little bit, and committing to two things, but not writing either of them now.

1. I will write-up a summary of my favorite papers at the recent CSCSW 2016 conference I attended. There's a lot of cool work coming out of the community, and I want to write-up the pieces that I tank are worth paying attention to.
2. I'm in the middle of transitioning this website to [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com), from [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws).I want to explain why that is, but it definitely relates to my [continued infatuation with Python](http://jacob.thebault-spieker.com/ephemera/2016-01-26-iron-blogging:-simplifying-workflows/)

So, that's that. I'm not writing either of these for now, but I'm writing about writing them.
