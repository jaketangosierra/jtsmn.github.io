Well, I've continued to not write. That's a failing. I've been trying to do other things, because there is never enough time in the day.

That's not justification. However, I am finishing up a piece of analysis that I want to show off about at some point, on the [Spatial Decomposition of the Theil Index](http://jacob.thebault-spieker.com/ephemera/2015-11-13-iron-blogging:-inequality-indices-for-platform-accountability/). I'm hoping to get that out next week.

That's all for now folks. Good night, and good luck.
