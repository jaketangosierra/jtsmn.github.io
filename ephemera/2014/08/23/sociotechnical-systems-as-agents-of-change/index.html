    <p><strong>Update:</strong>
According to the article danah boyd sent out, Twitter says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We select each tweet using a variety of signals, including how popular it is
and how people in your network are interacting with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://jeffreynichols.com">Jeff Nichols</a>
(<a href="http://twitter.com/jwnichls">\@jwnichls</a> on Twitter) pointed out, this can be
a positive thing, and for some is what they use Twitter for. This strikes me as
not anti-homophily, the way danah boyd suggests, but instead what Recommender
Systems people call "serendipity". It seems it can't be anti-homphily if this
is partially based on people in your network's interactions. I'm not certain
this changes the higher-level point of the original posting, but it does add
some context. I've modified the original posting to reflect this context.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Twitter has been inserting tweets into other people's timelines, based on the
favoriting patterns of those tweets and how your own social network is
interacting with these tweets. That is, it's possible for me to favorite a
tweet, and because I've done so, it will appear in others' timelines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.danah.org">danah boyd</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/zephoria">\@zephoria</a> on
Twitter) suggests that this may be an anti-homophily move:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I&#39;m not surprised that people don&#39;t like being exposed to random tweets, but I see this as an anti-homophily move: <a href="http://t.co/RDst21PoZ8">http://t.co/RDst21PoZ8</a></p>&mdash; danah boyd (@zephoria) <a href="https://twitter.com/zephoria/statuses/503273388442652673">August 23, 2014</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What would it take for people to actually get excited by being exposed to perspectives from strangers? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dreaming?src=hash">#dreaming</a></p>&mdash; danah boyd (@zephoria) <a href="https://twitter.com/zephoria/statuses/503273545263480832">August 23, 2014</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I find this argument very intriguing, because I have two orthogonal reactions
to this idea. I am going break these ideas into sections, because I think they
deserve their own treatment.</p>
<h2>The role of the platform ought to be neutral</h2>
<p>My first reaction to this concept was approximately "<em>why does Twitter get to
decide that I need less homophily in my timeline?</em>". I think this fair
from an autonomy perspective, don't people deserve to choose what
they view? There's a number of ways Twitter could also use this mechanism that
isn't a "pure" anti-homophily effort, from advertising to a curated "Twitter"
experience designed to keep you engaged on their site. Under this framing,
inserting others' tweets into my timeline struck me as invasive, and the
opposite of the reason I use Twitter. I <em>like</em> the process of choosing what
shows in my timeline. <em>I</em> get to choose to be homophilic or not.</p>
<h2>The platform ought to recognize the power that it has, and pursue "social good".</h2>
<p>However, the recent events in Ferguson are a stark reminder of the socialized,
institutionalized racism that still occurs in the United States. How does
society combat this? There are structural approaches, like oversight of police
forces. However, there are a number of underlying mechanisms (historical, or
legal structures) at play that lead to this sort of racialized response (let
alone the shooting of Michael Brown that sparked these protests). One of these
mechanisms has been said to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Distance_Corollary">social
distance</a>, which leads
to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othering">othering</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter, as a medium, played a role in dissemination of information on the
ground, discussion of race issues, and a more timely exposure to these events
than other news media. It also served as a platform for people saying very
bigoted, racist things, while supporting the actions of the police. Homophily
allowed people to choose which side of this issue they were exposed to through
Twitter. Anti-homophily <em>could</em> have served to expose those who were
ambivalent, or supporting the police action, to an alternative view of these
events (there are questions of safety and harassment that would need to be
addressed, certainly).</p>
<p>As the platform owners, Twitter is in a unique position to make these kinds of
decisions. Is being "exposed to perspectives from strangers" a positive thing?
Conceivably, a move by Twitter to counteract homophily could serve to decrease
social distance and reducing the othering effects.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>This is an example of what anti-homophily could bring to bear on the
Twitter platform, and danah boyd certainly seems to believe that non-homophily
is a good thing (at least if people are excited by it on their own).</p>
<p>If she is right, and Twitter is using favorites as a way to counteract
homophily on their platform, what obligations do they have? What is Twitter's
purpose behind anti-homophily measures? How do builders of sociotechnical systems
choose the attributes that support "social good" (for whatever that means in a given
context)?</p>
<p>If Twitter can make the argument that favorites-as-anti-homophily does decrease
social distance among their users, or perhaps even supports users choosing to
counteract homophily on their own, I find this argument compelling. It situates
platforms as "social change" shephards, or perhaps in extreme cases, digital
community organizers. Is this a role platform owners identify as one they're
taking on?  How does one separate the algorithmic change imposed on their
users, and the obligation to monitor and curate this change, even if the change
is for business purposes?</p>
