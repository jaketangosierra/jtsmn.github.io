engagement efforts on Twitter. Successfully completed this project*
**Skills:** defining a research plan, experimental design, working
collaboratively with a team

University of Minnesota, Department of Computer Science, Research
Assistant, *2011-Present*.\
*I’ve been the lead developer for over 3 years building a mobile,
geographic crowdsourcing application (FolkSource) that is nearing
launch. I conducted semi-structured interviews with users in a
case-study to understand motivations for using the system.*\

Semi-structured interviewing

Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Computer Science, REU Student,
*Summer 2010*.\
*Researched the feasibility of prefetching in Internet Suspend/Resume.
Demonstrated that the simple (boot) case does not provide performance
improvements.*\
**Skills:** C, collaborative research with Dr. Mahadev Satyanarayanan.

University of Minnesota – Morris, Department of Computer Science &
OpenAFS, Undergraduate Research Project, *Jan. 2010 - June 2010*.\
*Extension of 2009 Google Summer of Code project, researched the use of
network and server statistics to optimize server rankings and explored
the distribution these statistics within the system.*\
**Skills:** C, independently motivated project, collaborative remotely.

transition process for transgendered individuals.*\
**Skills:** Coding transgendered forum data for definition of system
goals (in place of user interviews for anonymity). Iterative
development, UI techniques.

**PSY 5108H: Mathematical Models of Human Behavior**\
*I conducted a literature review focused on the importance of intrinsic
motivation in the success of an online open-production community.*\
**Skills:** Bayes nets, game theory (including Nash Equilibria), time
series, Collective Effort Model, role of intrinsic & extrinsic
motivation in effort processes.

**Other Courses Taken:** *Advanced Algorithms, Principles of Database
Systems, Foundations of Advanced Networking, and Introduction to
Research I & II, Directed Research*

Other Experience {#other-experience .unnumbered}
================

University of Minnesota, Department of Computer Science, Teaching
Assistant, 2011.\
*I TA’d **CS 1902: Structures of Computer Programming II** for 2
semesters. This included managing 3 lab sessions per week, and grading
homework and exams.*\
**Skills:** Lead 3 lab sessions, collaborative course management with a
graduate student and the Professor.

Google Summer of Code, OpenAFS, Participant, *Summer 2009*.\
*Began using network statistics (latency, bandwidth, etc.) in order to
improve client server choices. Implemented this in both Linux and
Windows.*\
**Skills:** C, Independently proposed and driven project, collaborative
remotely.

Google Summer of Code, OpenAFS, Participant, *Summer 2008*.\
*Implemented GPL-licensed Linux kernel interfaces to handle AFS Remote
Procedure Calls (RPCs). Intended to support native Linux interaction
with AFS, so AFS wouldn’t need to maintain a kernel module.*\
**Skills:** C, Independently proposed and driven project, collaborative
remotely.
