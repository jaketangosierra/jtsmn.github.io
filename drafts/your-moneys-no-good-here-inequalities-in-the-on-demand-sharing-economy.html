    <p>“<a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com">Help around the home is just a few clicks away</a>”, unless you live in poor areas or the ’burbs.</p>
<p>That slogan (in quotes above) is how a website called TaskRabbit bills it’s services. TaskRabbit (part of the “sharing economy”) lets you “describe your task, choose a Tasker, kick back &amp; relax”. You can outsource your chores and small jobs, on-demand, to the crowd in your city. Similar to how Uber lets you outsource your transportation, TaskRabbit can be understood as “Uber for small jobs”.</p>
<p>That all sounds wonderful, and suggests that the <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/its-not-just-nice-to-share-its-the-future/">the future of work</a> may be getting closer. However, if you live in poorer areas or out in the suburbs, our work suggests that TaskRabbit “Taskers” are <em>less willing</em> to come to where you live and do tasks. If there is a Tasker that’s willing to do your task, you’re going to <em>pay more for them to come complete your job</em>.</p>
<p>If a Tasker is faced with 2 tasks that are equally far away from them, but one is located in an area with a median household income <strong>twice</strong> that of the second, our results suggest that the Tasker is approximately <strong>2.5x as likely</strong> to complete the task in the first, wealthier, area.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a Tasker is choosing between 2 tasks in areas with the same median household income, but one is <strong>an hour</strong> away, we expect that task to be approximately <strong>$10 more expensive</strong> (which is higher than the federal minimum wage).</p>
<p><em>Because</em> of these willingness and price findings, people that don’t live near Taskers have less access to the services and economic benefits that TaskRabbit can provide. Unfortunately, in our representative sample, this means that people who live in poorer areas, or suburban areas have a disadvantage in being able to use TaskRabbit’s service.</p>
<p>In order for people become Taskers in TaskRabbit, they must be a US citizen, pass a background check, have a bank account, and maintain a Facebook or LinkedIn account. These factors may influence the ability of people to act as Taskers. Interestingly, Uber has similar requirements for participation (owning a car, having insurance, passing a background check), and thus we may see similar trends in services like UberX.</p>
<p>TaskRabbit is also one of the services backing the new Amazon Home Services, an effort by Amazon to use their success with on-demand digital tasks (Amazon Mechanical Turk) into on-demand physical tasks. Therefore, our findings likely apply to Amazon Home Services as well.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more information in our paper, which is available as a <a href="http://jacob.thebault-spieker.com/CSCW15_TaskRabbit.pdf">pre-print</a>, or through the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2675133.2675278">ACM</a>, please check it out!</p>
