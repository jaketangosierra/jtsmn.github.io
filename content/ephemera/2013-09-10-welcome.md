This is the first, welcome post on the blog here. I hope to write fairly
regularly. I\'ll likely post thoughts on current events related to CS/HCI
broadly, or topics that interest me related to social change movements and
efforts, and the (potential) role that technology plays. Additionally, I\'ll
 summary posts about papers of mine that have been accepted, and potentially
other topics as I see fit.

So, welcome.
