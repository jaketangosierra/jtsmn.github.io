"[Help around the home is just a few clicks
away](https://www.taskrabbit.com)", unless you live in poor areas or the
'burbs.

That slogan (in quotes above) is how a website called TaskRabbit bills
it's services. TaskRabbit (part of the "sharing economy") lets you
"describe your task, choose a Tasker, kick back & relax". You can
outsource your chores and small jobs, on-demand, to the crowd in your
city.  Similar to how Uber lets you outsource your transportation,
TaskRabbit can be understood as "Uber for small jobs".

That all sounds wonderful, and suggests that the [the future of
work](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/its-not-just-nice-to-share-its-the-future/)
may be getting closer. However, if you live in poorer areas or out in
the suburbs, our work suggests that TaskRabbit "Taskers" are _less
willing_ to come to where you live and do tasks. If there is a
Tasker that's willing to do your task, you're going to _pay more for
them to come complete your job_.

If a Tasker is faced with 2 tasks that are equally far away from them,
but one is located in an area with a median household income **twice**
that of the second, our results suggest that the Tasker is approximately
**2.5x as likely** to complete the task in the first, wealthier, area.

Similarly, if a Tasker is choosing between 2 tasks in areas with the
same median household income, but one is **an hour** away, we expect
that task to be approximately **\$10 more expensive** (which is higher
than the federal minimum wage).

_Because_ of these willingness and price findings, people that don't live
near Taskers have less access to the services and economic benefits that
TaskRabbit can provide. Unfortunately, in our representative sample,
this means that people who live in poorer areas, or suburban areas
have a disadvantage in being able to use TaskRabbit's service.

In order for people become Taskers in TaskRabbit, they must be a US
citizen, pass a background check, have a bank account, and maintain a
Facebook or LinkedIn account. These factors may influence the ability of
people to act as Taskers. Interestingly, Uber has similar requirements
for participation (owning a car, having insurance, passing a background
check), and thus we may see similar trends in services like UberX.

TaskRabbit is also one of the services backing the new Amazon Home
Services, an effort by Amazon to use their success with on-demand
digital tasks (Amazon Mechanical Turk) into on-demand physical tasks.
Therefore, our findings likely apply to Amazon Home Services as well.
