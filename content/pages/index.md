Hi, welcome.

In case you couldn't tell by the URL, I'm Jake.

Here you'll find my academic work, and various other ephemera.

__I spend my time\...__

* __Thinking__ about the role technology can play in social change, to empower
individuals and groups of people both individually and organizationally. In particular, my focus is on geographic biases in social computing systems.

* __Studying__ at the University of Minnesota, and I work in the
[GroupLens](http://grouplens.org/) HCI lab, with [Dr. Loren
Terveen](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~terveen/). My particular interests lie in
the ways that technology can support and augment social goals and processes.  

* __Building__ a system called FolkSource, for crowdsourcing data in the world
around us.

* __Photographing__ the minutae in the world. I try to capture the things that are
in the world, but not at the forefront of what people are attentive to. I really
enjoy both the technical and the (I believe) artistic aspects of the medium.
